# Paypal Basics

This project illustrates how to manage payments in a Rails 4 application using Paypal service.

This is divided in three branches: 'master', 'cards' and 'recurring'. Each branch corresponds with one 'Tealeaf academy' article:

* ["Process Payments With Paypal in Rails"](http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/basic-paypal-checkout-processing-in-rails): Using Paypal express accepting payments through Paypal accounts. Corresponds with [master] branch.
* ["Paypal payments with credit cards"](http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/paypal-payments-with-credit-cards): Creating our form to accept Credit card Payments without redirecting to another page or gateway. Corresponds with [cards] branch.
* ["Recurring Payments With Paypal"](http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/paypal-recurring-payments): Here both payment methods in the first articles are adapted to process recurring payments. Corresponds with [recurring] branch.

Enjoy!
